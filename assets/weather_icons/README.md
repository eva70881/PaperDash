# Weather Icons Placeholder

PaperDash expects you to provide monochrome 300Ã—300 BMP icons for each weather
condition listed below. Place the bitmaps in this folder using the exact file
names so the dashboard can discover them at runtime.

| Weather code | Display text  | Bitmap filename        |
|--------------|---------------|------------------------|
| 0            | Clear         | `clear.bmp`            |
| 1            | Mostly clr    | `mostly_clear.bmp`     |
| 2            | Partly cldy   | `partly_cloudy.bmp`    |
| 3            | Cloudy        | `cloudy.bmp`           |
| 45           | Fog           | `fog.bmp`              |
| 48           | Rime fog      | `rime_fog.bmp`         |
| 51           | Drizzle       | `drizzle.bmp`          |
| 61           | Light rain    | `light_rain.bmp`       |
| 63           | Rain          | `rain.bmp`             |
| 65           | Heavy rain    | `heavy_rain.bmp`       |
| 71           | Snow          | `snow.bmp`             |
| 80           | Rain showers  | `rain_showers.bmp`     |

If an icon file is missing, PaperDash automatically falls back to the configured
logo so the dashboard still renders cleanly.
