# Weather Icons Placeholder

Place your `sunny.bmp`, `cloudly.bmp`, `raining.bmp`, and `snow.bmp` bitmaps in this directory.
They should be monochrome BMP files sized for the PaperDash display (64x64 works well). When an
icon is missing, PaperDash will automatically use the configured logo instead.
